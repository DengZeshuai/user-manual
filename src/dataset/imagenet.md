# ImageNet

<dataset-info/>

[image-net.org](http://image-net.org/)

ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. Currently we have an average of over five hundred images per node.

本文件夹中包含的数据（应该是）来自[ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSVRC2012)](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index)。包含训练集和测试集，1000分类。
