This is a large-scale, high-quality video dataset, Vimeo90K. 
This dataset consists of 89,800 video clips downloaded from vimeo.com, which covers large variaty of scenes and actions. 
It is designed for the following four video processing tasks: temporal frame interpolation, video denoising, video deblocking, and video super-resolution.

video super-resolution:
The septuplet dataset consists of 91,701 7-frame sequences with fixed resolution 448 x 256, extracted from 39K selected video clips from Vimeo-90K.
I have used the matlab script to downscale all frames by a factor of 4, and the downsampled frames are saved in `vimeo_septuplet_matlabLRx4`.
